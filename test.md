 ### Step 3 - Once you open the Developer tools the default will be the "Elements" tab but we will need to go to "Network" tab.
 Inside the "Network" tab look for **logs with {j} icon** and go to **"Payload"**, in **"Payload"** you will see the **application, action and label** that you can use when looking for the button click in DEAL data.

 ### Tip - Clear the network log between clicks to not get confused between old data
